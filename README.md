# loki-jsonnet

An opinionated set of jsonnet files to setup Loki, promtail and loki-canary without a distributed storage or NoSQL database for the index.

Note this started as an experiment in order to benchmark Loki's local storage, it's early stage and ideally this could be merged back into the upstream Loki jsonnet files eventually.
